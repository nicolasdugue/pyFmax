# pyFmax
A package to deal with Feature F-Measure**[1][2][3][4]**, Feature Maximisation, Feature selection, and clustering quality indexes based on feature contrasts **[1]**.


####Install
To make it work, your need to set up python and to install the numpy package

    pip install numpy

####Usage

Exemple exemple.py gives a good example of how to use the package in your Python code.
This example makes use of data stored in data/exemple that are extracted from **[1]**.
